## Guidelines for contributing

Please follow [Java coding standards](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~tp_200/ics111/material/codingStandards.html) and comment often, so everyone else can understand what your code does.

Every class and method should be preceded with a descriptive comment using Javadoc notational convention. 

Please compile and run your code at least once before pushing to a main branch like master or develop.
If the code won't run, save your changes to a personal branch instead on a branch others rely on.
